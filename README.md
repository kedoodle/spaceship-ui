# Spaceship UI

A frontend used to get a better understanding of your Spaceship Voyager investment. 

Note that this project is intended for education purposes only and should not be used as an alternative to the Spaceship provided interfaces.


## About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses `http-proxy-middleware` to [proxy API requests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) to Spaceship. After an initial login, authentication is maintained using `axios` interceptors to ensure a valid bearer token is attached to each request.


## Usage

`npm start` will run the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.
